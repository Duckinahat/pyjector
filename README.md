pyjector - open source video server for live projection cues

WORK IN PROGRESS

This project is very much so not ready for release.  There are many bugs, there are no comments, use at your own risk.

Pyjector requires gstreamer 1.6 or greater as well as the python bindings

For testing, make a folder in your home directory and fill it with videos labled 00.mp4 - 31.mp4
Run ./player.py and enjoy
